Face Detection Project

This Python project implements a simple real-time face detection system using the OpenCV library (cv2).
It captures live video from your webcam, detects human faces in each frame using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier, 
and draws green bounding rectangles around detected faces for visualization. The program runs in a continuous loop 
until you press the 'a' key to exit. It's an excellent beginner-friendly example of computer vision basics, suitable
for applications like security monitoring, attendance systems, or interactive apps. Below, I'll break it down step
by step, including setup notes and potential improvements.
